## Background
This was a week-long project built to incorporate both back-end and front-end skills learned through DigitalCraft's web development course. Project goals included setting up an application using Express and PostgreSQL for the back-end, and HTML/CSS for the front-end. Data was pulled from an external API, and the user was able to save that info to thier account if they were logged in. They could later retrieve that info under a favorites page.
